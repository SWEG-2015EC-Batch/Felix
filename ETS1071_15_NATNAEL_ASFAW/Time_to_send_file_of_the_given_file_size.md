A.) Problem Analysis:
  The task requires creating a program that calculates the time needed to send a file over a serial transmission line given the file size, considering a transmission speed of 960 characters per second. The file size provided is 400MB (419,430,400 bytes), and the transmission speed is 960 characters per second. Here is the problem analysis:

1. **Input:**
   - Transmission speed: 960 characters per second (constant value).
   - File size: 400MB (419,430,400 bytes) - this is the value we will work with.

2. **Calculation:**
   - Convert the file size to bits, as transmission speed is in characters per second (1 byte = 8 bits).
   - Calculate the time required to transmit the entire file using the formula: `timeInSeconds = fileSizeBits / transmissionSpeed`.

3. **Output:**
   - Display the calculated time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.


B.)Aligorithm Design:
1. **Start**
2. Declare constants:
   - `transmissionSpeed` = 960 characters per second
   - `fileSizeBytes` = 419,430,400 bytes (400MB)
3. Calculate the file size in bits:
   - `fileSizeBits = fileSizeBytes * 8` (convert bytes to bits)
4. Calculate the time required to send the file:
   - `timeInSeconds = fileSizeBits / transmissionSpeed`
5. Convert `timeInSeconds` to days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. Display the calculated time to the user.
7. **End**

Pseudocode:

START

  1. SET transmissionSpeed = 960 (characters per second)
  2. SET fileSizeBytes = 419430400 (400MB in bytes)
  3. SET fileSizeBits = fileSizeBytes * 8 (convert bytes to bits)
  4. SET timeInSeconds = fileSizeBits / transmissionSpeed
  5. SET days = timeInSeconds / (24 * 3600)
  6. SET timeInSeconds = timeInSeconds - (days * 24 * 3600)
  7. SET hours = timeInSeconds / 3600
  8. SET timeInSeconds = timeInSeconds - (hours * 3600)
  9. SET minutes = timeInSeconds / 60
  10. SET seconds = timeInSeconds - (minutes * 60)
  11. DISPLAY "Time required to send the file:"
  12. DISPLAY "Days: days, Hours: hours, Minutes: minutes, Seconds: seconds"
