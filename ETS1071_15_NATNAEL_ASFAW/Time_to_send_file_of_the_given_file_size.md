A.) Problem Analysis:
  The task requires creating a program that calculates the time needed to send a file over a serial transmission line given the file size, considering a transmission speed of 960 characters per second. The file size provided is 400MB (419,430,400 bytes), and the transmission speed is 960 characters per second. Here is the problem analysis:

1. **Input:**
   - Transmission speed: 960 characters per second (constant value).
   - File size: 400MB (419,430,400 bytes) - this is the value we will work with.

2. **Calculation:**
   - Convert the file size to bits, as transmission speed is in characters per second (1 byte = 8 bits).
   - Calculate the time required to transmit the entire file using the formula: `timeInSeconds = fileSizeBits / transmissionSpeed`.

3. **Output:**
   - Display the calculated time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.


B.)Aligorithm Design:
1. **Start**
2. Declare constants:
   - `transmissionSpeed` = 960 characters per second
   - `fileSizeBytes` = 419,430,400 bytes (400MB)
3. Calculate the file size in bits:
   - `fileSizeBits = fileSizeBytes * 8` (convert bytes to bits)
4. Calculate the time required to send the file:
   - `timeInSeconds = fileSizeBits / transmissionSpeed`
5. Convert `timeInSeconds` to days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. Display the calculated time to the user.
7. **End**
