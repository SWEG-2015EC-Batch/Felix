A.)Problem Analysis: Calculating Automobile Range
 To create a program that calculates the maximum distance an automobile can travel without needing a refuel, based on the fuel tank's capacity and the vehicle's miles per gallon efficiency.
 Inputs:
  Tank Capacity (in gallons): This value represents the maximum amount of fuel the automobile's tank can hold.
  Miles per Gallon Efficiency: This value signifies the distance the automobile can cover per gallon of fuel.
 Output:
  The program will output the total distance the automobile can travel without refueling, based on the provided tank capacity and miles per gallon efficiency.
B.)Algorithm Design:
  Step1.Start
  Step2.Declare variables tankCapacity, milesPerGallon, and milesPossible of type double.
  Step3.Display a message to prompt the user to input the fuel tank capacity (tankCapacity).
  Step4.Read and store the user input into the variable tankCapacity.
  Step5.Display a message to prompt the user to input the miles per gallon (milesPerGallon).
  Step6.Read and store the user input into the variable milesPerGallon.
  Step7.Calculate milesPossible by multiplying tankCapacity with milesPerGallon.
  Step8.Display the calculated value of milesPossible as the number of miles the automobile can be driven without refueling.
  Step9.End
Pseudocode:
Start

Declare variables tankCapacity, milesPerGallon, milesPossible as double

Display "Enter the capacity of the fuel tank in gallons: "
Read tankCapacity

Display "Enter the miles per gallon of the automobile: "
Read milesPerGallon

milesPossible = tankCapacity * milesPerGallon

Display "The automobile can be driven for " + milesPossible + " miles without refueling."

End
This algorithm design outlines the steps needed to achieve the desired functionality of the program in a structured manner, providing a clear sequence of actions to solve the problem.
