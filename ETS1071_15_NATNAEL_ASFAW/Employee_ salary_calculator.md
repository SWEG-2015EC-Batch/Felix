A.) Problem Analysis:
The problem requires designing an algorithm and a program to calculate an employee's gross salary, net salary, and bonus payment based on the provided information: employee name, weekly working hours, bonus rate per hour, and base salary. Additionally, the problem hints at considering a pension rate of -5% and a tax rate of 15%. Here's the analysis:

1. **Input:**
   - Employee name: String input.
   - Weekly working hours: Numeric input (hours worked per week).
   - Bonus rate per hour: Numeric input (additional pay rate per hour worked).
   - Base salary: Numeric input (fixed salary amount).

2. **Calculations:**
   - Calculate the gross salary:
     - Gross Salary = Base Salary + (Weekly Working Hours * Bonus Rate per Hour)
   - Calculate the pension deduction:
     - Pension Deduction = Gross Salary * 0.05 (5% deduction)
   - Calculate the net salary:
     - Net Salary = Gross Salary - Pension Deduction - (Gross Salary * 0.15) (15% tax deduction)
   - Calculate the bonus payment:
     - Bonus Payment = Weekly Working Hours * Bonus Rate per Hour

3. **Output:**
   - Display the employee's name, gross salary, net salary, and bonus payment.

B.) Algorithm Design:

1. **Start**
2. Input employee name, weekly working hours, bonus rate per hour, and base salary.
3. Calculate gross salary:
   - `Gross Salary = Base Salary + (Weekly Working Hours * Bonus Rate per Hour)`
4. Calculate pension deduction:
   - `Pension Deduction = Gross Salary * 0.05`
5. Calculate tax deduction:
   - `Tax Deduction = Gross Salary * 0.15`
6. Calculate net salary:
   - `Net Salary = Gross Salary - Pension Deduction - Tax Deduction`
7. Calculate bonus payment:
   - `Bonus Payment = Weekly Working Hours * Bonus Rate per Hour`
8. Display employee name, gross salary, net salary, and bonus payment.
9. **End**
