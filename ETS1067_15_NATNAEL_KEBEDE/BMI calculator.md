Algorithm Design:

Input: Prompt the user to enter their height in meters.
Read the height input.
Input: Prompt the user to enter their weight in kilograms.
Read the weight input.
Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula: BMI= Weight/ (Height×Height)
​Display the calculated BMI to the user.

Problem Analysis:

Inputs: The program takes two inputs: height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms) from the user.
Processing: It calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula BMI = Weight / (Height * Height).
Output: The program displays the calculated BMI to the user.
