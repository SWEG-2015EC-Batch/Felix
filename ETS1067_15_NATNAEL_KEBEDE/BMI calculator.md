# Problem Analysis:

Inputs: The program takes two inputs: height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms) from the user.

Processing: It calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula BMI = Weight / (Height * Height).

Output: The program displays the calculated BMI to the user.

# Algorithm Design:

1 Input: Prompt the user to enter their height in meters.

2 Read the height input.

3 Input: Prompt the user to enter their weight in kilograms.

4 Read the weight input.

5 Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula: 

6 BMI= weight/(Height×Height)

7 ​Display the calculated BMI to the user.
