Problem Analysis:

Inputs: The program prompts the user for two inputs: tank capacity (in gallons) and miles per gallon the automobile can travel.

Processing: It multiplies the tank capacity by the miles per gallon to calculate the total miles the automobile can travel without refueling.

Output: The program displays the calculated miles without refueling to the user.

Algorithm Design:

1 Input: Ask the user to input the capacity of the fuel tank in gallons.

2 Read and store the tank capacity.

3 Input: Ask the user to input the miles per gallon the automobile can travel.

4 Read and store the miles per gallon value.

5 Calculate the miles the automobile can travel without refueling using the formula: 

6 Miles without Refueling=Tank Capacity×Miles per Gallon

7 Miles without Refueling=Tank Capacity×Miles per Gallon

8 Display the calculated miles without refueling to the user.
