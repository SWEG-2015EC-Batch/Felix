# problem analaysis

Input: The user is prompted to enter the file size in bytes.

Process: The program calculates the transmission time based on the given transmission rate of 960 characters per second: transmissionTime = fileSizeInCharacters / transmissionRate.

Output: The program displays the time required to transmit the file in seconds.

                                          Algorithm Design 

1 Display "Enter the file size in bytes: " prompt

2 Read user input and store it in the variable fileSizeInBytes

3 Set fileSizeInCharacters to fileSizeInBytes

4 Calculate transmissionTime using the formula: transmissionTime = fileSizeInCharacters / transmissionRate

5 Display "Time required to transmit the file: ", transmissionTime, " seconds"

6 End program
