This program calculates the number of miles a car can travel without refueling.

                                      Analysis

Input:
The user is prompted to enter the capacity of the car's fuel tank in gallons.
The user is prompted to enter the miles per gallon the automobile can be driven.

Process:
The program calculates the number of miles the car can travel without refueling using the formula: num_miles = fuel_capacity * miles_per_gal.

Output:
The program displays the calculated number of miles the car can travel without refueling.

                                     Algorithm Design (pseudocode)
1. Display "Miles Calculator" title
2. Display "===============================================================" separator
3. Prompt user for input: "Please enter the capacity of your car's fuel tank in gallons: "
4. Read user input and store it in the variable fuel_capacity
5. Prompt user for input: "Please enter the miles per gallon your automobile can be driven: "
6. Read user input and store it in the variable miles_per_gal
7. Calculate num_miles using the formula: num_miles = fuel_capacity * miles_per_gal
8. Display "Your car can travel " followed by the calculated num_miles and " miles without refueling."
9. End program
